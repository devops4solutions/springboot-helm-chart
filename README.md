## ðŸš€ Publishing the Helm Chart  

This repository is configured to automatically **publish Helm Charts to GitHub Pages** using GitHub Actions.

### **Prerequisites**  
Before publishing, ensure:  
âœ… Your **GitHub repository** has a `charts/` directory containing Helm Charts  
âœ… You have a **GitHub Pages branch (`gh-pages`)** to store the published charts  
âœ… Your repository settings allow GitHub Pages from the `gh-pages` branch  

### ðŸ”„ **Publishing Steps**  
GitHub Actions will trigger automatically when:  
1. A **push is made to the `main` branch**  
2. A **manual workflow dispatch is triggered**  

To manually trigger the workflow:  
1. Go to **GitHub â†’ Actions**  
2. Select **Publish Helm Chart Workflow**  
3. Click **Run Workflow**  

Once the workflow completes, your Helm Chart will be available via **GitHub Pages**.
